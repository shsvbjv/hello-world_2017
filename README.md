# hello-world

This file is to be edited by Jellyfish_2017 software contributors...  
In addition to the intro text below, you will need to complete this "hello-world" exercise by adding 
your name to the bottom of this README.md file.  This list shall contain all of our software contributors,
whose GitHub login account will also be added to access our FTC Team Repository.

This is a repository exercise to get all our software builders in-sync on using GitHub to collaborate.
If you maded this far, you are one step closer to setting up your software development environment.
Familiarize yourself with the GitHub interface, and learn how to perform basic operations to:
* create a "branch" from the master trunk/branch to make changes,
* make a "commit", aka edit, add, or delete, to your branch,
* open a "pull_request" to compare the changes from the master branch, may have discussions with teammates,
* "merge" a pull_request back into the master branch.
Note, simple file edit may commit back to the master branch without "branch/pull_request/merge" operations.

Detail examples can be found at "https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/".
Note, not to create a new repository in Step 1 of above (github) example. 
You want to work with the existing repository from this "shsvbjv / hello-world" repository; 
so you can add your name at the end of this file.
This similar concept, one repository in the GitHub cloud, will be used to help us keep our software codes
in sync with eachother.  The goal is to execute a "branch" from the cloud to modify file(s) locally
on your compuater, then perform "commit/pull_request/merge" to get your VERIFIED changes back onto 
master trunk as quickly as feasible.

There is more info on the concept of GitHub at "https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/".
Don't forget to also get the latest Android Studio (Version 2.3.3, as of 9/4/2017) for IDE.

Congrats!!
